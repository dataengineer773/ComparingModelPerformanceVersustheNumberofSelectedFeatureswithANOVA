at this pproject we use the relationship between the number of selected features and classification accuracy, we may expect that more features results in a better performance to a point, the spread and mean
of these box plots would be expected to show ant intersting relationship between the number of selected features and the classification to show any intresting relationship between of selected features and the 
classification accuracy of the pipeline, in the next step frist report the mean and standard deviation for each number of slected features, in the finlal Box and whisker plots are created side-by-side are
showing the trend of increasing mean accuracy with the number of slected features to five features.
